          observations cover parallel subagent research and kspec batch operations - neither applies
          to this memory management work.

          required try/except + collect_ignore + importlib mode. This is systemic - every ComfyUI
          node pack with relative imports in __init__.py will hit this. Worth capturing the solution

          No runtime/ComfyUI smoke test exists - all tests are unit-level with mocks, so entire
          execution pipeline was untested with real data. (3) Codex review of pre-fix code was
