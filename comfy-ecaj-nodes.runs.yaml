          ## Session Review


          ### What worked well

          1. **Parallel dual reviews (pr-review + codex)** — Caught complementary issues. pr-review
          found code-level suggestions, Codex caught the spec/implementation divergence on ac-1.
          Running them in parallel was efficient.

          2. **Incremental plan-then-implement** — Planning the perf optimizations upfront
          identified that B2 (block pre-grouping) was deferred, then user feedback prompted adding
          it. The plan structure made it easy to add.

          3. **Previous session context recovery** — Picking up PR 33 from a context-exhausted
          session worked smoothly. Git status + gh pr view gave enough context to understand the
          state.

          4. **Test-first verification** — Running tests after each change caught the
          monkeypatch.setattr raising issue immediately.


          ### Friction points

          1. **monkeypatch.setattr raising=False** — The conftest comfy stub doesn't have
          current_loaded_models, so monkeypatch.setattr fails by default. This is a recurring
          pattern when adding new comfy APIs to test against. The stub should proactively include
          commonly-used attributes.

          2. **MockModelPatcher.clone() not matching real ComfyUI behavior** — clone() created a new
          .model object instead of sharing it. This caused is_clone() to fail. Had to fix the mock
          to match real behavior. Pattern: when adding mock methods that depend on object identity,
          verify the mock's object graph matches the real one.

          3. **OpSignature over-constraining discovered late** — The affecting_sets fragmentation
          was only identified when the user asked "are you ensuring larger batches go through."
          Could have been caught earlier during initial bottleneck analysis if we'd traced through
          the eval pipeline to see whether affecting_sets was actually used.

          ## High-confidence items


          ### Friction (1 item, systemic)

          - **Grouping over-constraining discovered late**: OpSignature included affecting_sets
          which was never used during evaluation — the loader already filters by set_id. This caused
          massive group fragmentation (200+ groups vs ~10). Pattern: when porting code from a
          reference implementation, verify each grouping criterion is actually consumed downstream,
          not just structurally present. This was only caught when the user asked about batch sizes.


          Already tracked:

          - MockModelPatcher.clone() identity issue → covered by inbox 01KH6Y5J and observation
          01KH6Y61

          - monkeypatch raising=False → one-off, not systemic


          ### Success (1 item)

          - **Dual reviewer agreement with complementary findings**: pr-review caught code-level
          suggestions, Codex caught spec/implementation divergence. Both approved correctness
          independently. This is the second session confirming this pattern (01KH6Y5Y already
          captures it).

          Step 1 - What Worked Well:

          1. Parallel agent research for MockModelPatcher audit — three agents (mock impl, real API,
          usage patterns) returned comprehensive results in one round, no follow-up needed

          2. Task pivoting — CI guard task pivoted from tooling to process enforcement (AGENTS.md +
          review skills) based on user preference, completed cleanly

          3. Factory pattern for DRY block config — data-driven factory was right abstraction, tests
          passed unchanged proving behavioral equivalence

          4. Subagent PR review with --no-merge flag — clean separation of review and merge
          decisions

        notes: >-
          Step 2 - Friction Points:

          1. Task lifecycle for audit/research tasks — 01KH7QY3 (mock audit) had no code changes but
          required submit→complete flow designed for PRs. Had to do submit+complete back-to-back
          which felt like ceremony for a research task.

          2. kspec task set API inconsistency — tried --description and --tags (plural) which don't
          exist; had to check --help to find --tag (singular) and that description must go through
          notes. Minor but slowed down task setup.

          3. Branch management after PR merge — was on refactor branch after merge, had to checkout
          main before committing the next task's changes. Easy to forget.

          Step 4 - Proposed Improvements:

          1. task complete --force should bypass submit requirement for non-code tasks (audits,
          research, docs-only). Scope: small (kspec CLI change). Already tried --force and it didn't
          work. Would eliminate the submit→complete ceremony for tasks that have no PR.

          ## Session Review


          ### What Worked Well

          1. **Comprehensive plan before execution** — The plan from plan mode had exact spec refs,
          AC text, task descriptions, and implementation notes. This made the kspec batch
          construction mechanical rather than creative.

          2. **Dry-run before execute** — Using `kspec batch --dry-run` caught the slug collision
          before committing, preventing partial state.

          3. **Atomic batch mode** — When commands failed mid-batch, atomic rollback prevented
          orphaned partial state. This was critical — 3 separate batch attempts rolled back cleanly
          before the 4th succeeded.


          ### Friction Points

          1. **kspec batch doesn't support forward references** — Tasks created in a batch can't be
          referenced by later commands in the same batch (e.g., task notes referencing a task
          created 2 commands earlier). Required splitting into 2 batches: create-then-annotate. This
          is a systemic issue that will recur whenever tasks need notes or dependencies on sibling
          tasks.

          2. **Global slug namespace** — Spec items and tasks share the same slug space. Creating
          spec `layer-type-filter` blocked creating task with same slug. Required using
          `layer-type-filter-impl` for the task. Not intuitive — expected namespacing by item type.

          3. **Batch JSON format discovery** — Had to trial-and-error 5 different JSON formats
          before finding `{"command": "...", "args": {"key": "value"}}`. The help output says 'JSON'
          but doesn't show the schema. Took 4 failed attempts.

          4. **Spike vs task confusion** — `kspec item get @layer-type-filtering` returned the
          spike, but `kspec item delete` said 'this is a task, use task cancel'. The item/task
          boundary is not clear from the get output.

          ## High-Confidence Items


          ### Friction: kspec batch lacks forward references (SYSTEMIC)

          - **Pattern**: Tasks created in a batch can't be referenced by later commands in the same
          batch. This forced splitting into 2 batches: create entities first, then annotate.

          - **Encountered**: 2 times this session (task notes referencing sibling tasks, depends-on
          referencing sibling task)

          - **Will recur**: Every time tasks with notes or cross-dependencies are created via batch

          - **Search result**: NOT tracked. Existing observation 01KH5142 covers batch success
          pattern but doesn't mention this limitation.

          - **Confidence**: HIGH — concrete, systemic, reproducible


          ### Not capturing (low confidence / one-off):

          - Global slug namespace collision: encountered once, learned the pattern, won't recur now
          that I know

          - Batch JSON format discovery: one-off learning curve, now in memory

          - Spike vs task type confusion: one-off

          ## Evaluation


          ### kspec batch forward reference limitation

          - Searched: 'batch forward reference', 'batch slug', 'batch schema', and broad 'batch' —
          no existing tracking

          - Existing observation 01KH5142 covers batch success but NOT this limitation

          - **Decision: CAPTURE** as friction observation

          1. Fast task completion - spec-unpatch-clones was straightforward: existing tests just
          needed AC annotation + new AC on the spec. Identified this quickly by reading the code and
          tests before starting.

          2. Parallel PR review via subagent - launched pr-review in background while staying
          available. Review came back clean with a useful style consistency observation.

          3. Memory note about pr-review no-merge paid off - correctly instructed subagent to review
          only, avoided accidental merge.

          1. Committed to main accidentally before creating feature branch - had to create branch
          after, soft-reset, recommit, force-push, then reset main back. This is a recurring
          pattern: should always create the branch BEFORE committing. Wasted ~5 tool calls cleaning
          up.

          2. AC annotation placement inconsistency - pr-review flagged that TestInstallMergedPatches
          puts # AC: before def, while I put it after def/before docstring. No standard documented
          anywhere. Minor but worth standardizing.

          3. kspec command discovery friction - had to try `kspec status` (doesn't exist), then
          `kspec tasks` (needs subcommand), then `kspec tasks next`. Also `kspec ac add` vs `kspec
          item ac add`. Multiple failed attempts to find the right command shape.

          Friction 2 (AC annotation placement): Partially covered — inbox item 01KHA976 tracks
          docstring-only annotations in test_graph.py, and convention 01KH509W says tests must have
          AC annotations, but neither specifies WHERE to place them (before def vs after def). No
          placement convention exists.

          Proposal 1: Add "always create branch before first commit" to MEMORY.md working
          principles. Scope: tiny (one line). Prevents the reset-main-after-accidental-commit dance.


          Proposal 2: Standardize AC annotation placement in testing convention. Two options: (a)
          before def line, or (b) after def/before docstring. Should pick one and document it so all
          tests are consistent. The existing codebase mostly uses before-def style
          (TestInstallMergedPatches, test_compile_plan.py). Scope: small — convention update +
          one-pass fix of the 5 tests just added in this session.


          Proposal 3: Skip kspec command discovery — this is upstream kspec UX, not something to
          track in this project.

          High-confidence items after search:


          FRICTION (not tracked):

          1. Plan import doesn't create structural depends_on/blocked_by from implementation notes
          dependency chain. Had to manually add 5 dependency links after import. Repeatable every
          time a plan with deps is imported. Existing coverage: spec-plan-import workflow mentions
          preview+import but not dependency setup.


          SUCCESS (not tracked):

          2. Subagent plan review for standalone-ness: Having a Plan agent review the plan doc
          against actual codebase caught 5 real blockers (wrong file paths, missing isinstance
          dispatch points, unspecified function signatures, performance implications, arch detection
          gap). This prevented a plan that would have stalled implementation. Pattern: review plan
          with subagent that reads actual code, not just the plan text.


          ALREADY TRACKED / SKIP:

          - Task lifecycle ceremony (start→submit→complete for spikes): Related to 01KH7MPS but
          different angle. However, discovered --skip-review flag exists on complete. The real
          friction was not knowing the CLI well enough — one-off learning, not systemic.

          - kspec CLI arg discovery (--title vs positional): One-off learning, captured in MEMORY.md
          already.

          Session: Implemented incremental block recomputation feature (16 ACs, ~1400 LOC).


          WHAT WORKED WELL:

          1. Plan-first approach: Having a detailed plan with exact file changes, AC list, and
          review findings pre-addressed made implementation smooth — no ambiguity during coding.

          2. Parallel reviews: Running pr-review + codex review in parallel caught complementary
          issues (pr-review found perf concern, codex found test gaps). Both converged quickly.

          3. Branch-before-commit discipline: Created feature branch before first commit, avoiding
          the reset-and-rebase cleanup pattern.

          4. Task tracking: Using TaskCreate/TaskUpdate kept work organized across 6 discrete steps.


          FRICTION POINTS:

          1. chunked_evaluation mock returning all keys instead of filtered keys — caused a test
          failure that required understanding the actual call semantics. This is a recurring
          pattern: mocks that return too much data hide bugs in tests.

          2. compile_plan needing set_id_map with actual RecipeLoRA object IDs — integration tests
          had to mock compile_plan too since the mock analyze_recipe returns different object IDs
          than what compile_plan expects. This coupling makes integration testing harder.

          3. codex agent tried to git checkout main after review, which is unnecessary and risky in
          a shared worktree. The worktree guard hook caught it.

          4. Full cache hit path was doing a redundant clone back to cache — caught by PR reviewer
          but could have been caught during implementation with more careful analysis of the data
          flow.

          Checked existing observations. Analysis:


          FRICTION 1 (chunked_evaluation mock returning all keys): This is a specific instance of
          existing observation 01KH6Y61 'Unit tests with mocks can validate the wrong behavior'.
          Already tracked. SKIP.


          FRICTION 2 (compile_plan/set_id_map coupling): One-off issue specific to these tests. Not
          systemic enough to capture. SKIP.


          FRICTION 3 (codex agent checkout main): One-off, caught by worktree guard hook. Working as
          designed. SKIP.


          FRICTION 4 (redundant clone on full cache hit): Caught by reviewer, one-off code issue.
          Not a process friction. SKIP.


          SUCCESS 1 (detailed plan with review findings pre-addressed): Already covered by existing
          observations 01KHCJHD and 01KHDNHK about plan review catching issues. The new aspect here
          is that the plan INCLUDED the review findings and their resolutions, so implementation was
          smooth. However, this is a natural extension of the plan review pattern, not a distinct
          observation. SKIP.


          SUCCESS 2 (parallel codex + pr-review): Already tracked in 01KH6Y5Y and 01KH9YAW. SKIP.


          SUCCESS 3 (branch-before-commit): Already tracked in 01KHAKZC (friction) and resolved in
          MEMORY.md. SKIP.


          CONCLUSION: All friction points and successes from this session are already covered by
          existing observations. Nothing new to capture.

        notes: "Session: spec-plan for two enhancements (model loader split + CLIP merging). WHAT WORKED
          WELL: (1) Asking design questions one-at-a-time via AskUserQuestion produced clear,
          well-scoped decisions. (2) Running parallel reviews (holistic subagent + Codex) caught
          overlapping issues with high confidence — arch=sdxl ambiguity, source_dir serialization
          gaps, CLIP patching TBD. (3) Iterating plan document based on review findings before
          import avoided importing broken specs. (4) The spec-plan-design workflow provided good
          structure (explore -> clarify -> design -> review -> choose path). FRICTION: (1) The
          dry-run/import cycle was smooth but the post-import review found zero dependency edges —
          the plan import format has no way to express task dependencies, so they always need manual
          setup after import. (2) Manual tasks in the plan YAML lose their description during import
          — investigate-clip-api had description in YAML but task showed no description field, only
          notes. (3) The umbrella/integration task pattern (parent depends on children) feels like a
          recurring need that could be formalized."

        notes: "HIGH CONFIDENCE ITEMS: (1) FRICTION - Manual task descriptions in plan YAML are imported as
          notes, not as the task description field. Verified: @investigate-clip-api has no
          Description section, content ended up in notes only. Systemic — happens for every manual
          task with description in plan import. NOT already tracked (inbox 01KHDNHH is about
          depends_on, different issue). (2) SUCCESS - One-at-a-time AskUserQuestion for design
          decisions during spec-plan is highly effective — produced 5 clear decisions (WIDEN
          algorithm, LoRA sharing, block config, loader scope, type safety) with no backtracking.
          Not tracked. (3) SUCCESS - Post-import subagent review for task standalone quality catches
          dependency gaps and missing context every time. This session and the Qwen/Flux session
          both benefited. Partially tracked by 01KHCJHD (subagent plan review for standalone-ness)
          but that was pre-import; this is specifically post-import review which is a distinct
          checkpoint. ALREADY TRACKED (skip): Plan import missing depends_on (inbox 01KHDNHH).
          Parallel holistic+Codex review (observation 01KHDNHK)."
