      The WIDEN custom ComfyUI type and its recipe dataclasses. All recipe
      objects are frozen (immutable) to prevent aliasing bugs with ComfyUI
      caching and graph fan-out. Fields use tuples, not lists. Recipe objects
      hold no GPU tensors -- they are pure recipe descriptions.

    title: Flux 2 Klein Architecture Support
    type: feature
    tags: []
    description: |
      Full WIDEN merge support for Flux 2 Klein (4B and 9B variants).
      Dual block types: double_blocks (joint img/txt attention with fused
      QKV per stream) and single_blocks (fused linear1 = QKV + MLP
      projection). Requires offset-based DeltaSpec for QKV fusing,
      following Z-Image's pattern in lib/lora/zimage.py.
      Klein 9B has 8 double + 24 single = 32 blocks.
      Klein 4B has 5 double + 20 single = 25 blocks.
      Block config sized for Klein 9B max. Flux.1 out of scope for now.
      Key files to modify: nodes/entry.py, lib/block_classify.py,
      lib/lora/ (new flux.py), lib/model_loader.py,
      nodes/block_config_flux.py (new), __init__.py.

        when: detect_architecture() runs
        then: it returns "flux" and "flux" is in _SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES

        given: a parameter key from a Flux Klein model
        when: classify_key_flux() is called
        then: |
          double_blocks.N maps to DB00-DB07 (9B) or DB00-DB04 (4B).
          single_blocks.N maps to SB00-SB23 (9B) or SB00-SB19 (4B).
          Block indices are discovered dynamically from keys (not hardcoded).
          Non-block keys (guidance_in, time_in, vector_in, img_in, txt_in,
          final_layer) return None.
      - id: ac-3

          norm.query_norm, norm.key_norm.
          Returns "feed_forward" for img_mlp, txt_mlp, linear2.
          Returns "norm" for img_mod, txt_mod, modulation
          (excluding attention-specific norms already captured above).

          separate LoRA to_q/to_k/to_v components map to fused
          img_attn.qkv and txt_attn.qkv base model keys with
          DeltaSpec kind=qkv_q/qkv_k/qkv_v and offset=(start, length)
          tuples. Two QKV fusions per double_block (one per stream).
      - id: ac-5
        given: a Flux LoRA targeting single_block components
        when: FluxLoader parses it

          with DeltaSpec kind=qkv_q/qkv_k/qkv_v and offset tuples.
          proj_mlp maps with a new offset-aware kind (e.g. offset_mlp)
          and offset tuple. The gpu_ops.py offset-slice branch (line 200)
          is extended to include the new kind.
