        when: get_weights(keys) is called
        then: |
          it returns the corresponding weight tensors from the checkpoint
          file, correctly mapped from file key format to base model key format
      - id: ac-3
        given: an SDXL checkpoint file with model.diffusion_model prefix
        when: key mapping runs
        then: |
          file keys are normalized to match base model state dict keys
          (e.g., model.diffusion_model.input_blocks.0 maps to input_blocks.0)
      - id: ac-4
        given: a Z-Image checkpoint file
        when: key mapping runs
        then: |
          file keys are normalized to match base model state dict keys,
          handling the diffusion_model or transformer prefix variants
      - id: ac-5
        given: the loader
        when: affected_keys is accessed
        then: |
          it returns the set of base model keys that have corresponding
          diffusion model weights in the checkpoint file, excluding
          VAE and text encoder keys
      - id: ac-6
        given: the loader is no longer needed
        when: cleanup() is called
        then: the safe_open file handle is closed and resources freed
      - id: ac-7
        given: a checkpoint file with keys that don't match the base model
        when: the mismatch is detected
        then: a clear error is raised listing unmatched keys
      - id: ac-8
        given: the loader
        when: detecting architecture from file keys
        then: |
          it can determine architecture without loading any tensor data
          by inspecting normalized keys against architecture patterns
      - id: ac-9
        given: a non-safetensors checkpoint file (e.g., .ckpt, .pt)
        when: the loader attempts to open it
        then: |
          a clear error is raised explaining that only safetensors
          format is supported for model merging

    title: Full Model Execution
    type: feature

    description: |
      Exit node extension for executing WIDEN merge on full model checkpoints.
      Adds OpApplyModel operation to the recipe evaluation engine. During
      recipe analysis, detects RecipeModel nodes and opens streaming loaders.
      During batched evaluation, OpApplyModel loads model weights per-batch
      into registers, then existing OpFilterDelta/OpMergeWeights apply WIDEN
      importance routing unchanged. Validates architecture consistency between
      base model and merge models. Adding RecipeModel as a 5th recipe type
      requires updating all isinstance dispatch points across the codebase.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - id: ac-1
        given: a recipe tree containing RecipeModel nodes
        when: recipe analysis runs (lib/analysis.py)
        then: |
          it detects RecipeModel nodes, opens FullModelLoader instances for
          each unique path, and builds affected-key maps per model
      - id: ac-2
        given: a RecipeModel in a recipe tree
        when: compile_plan processes it
        then: an OpApplyModel op is emitted referencing the model's loader ID
      - id: ac-3
        given: execute_plan encounters OpApplyModel
        when: executing a batch of keys
        then: |
          it loads the model weight tensors for those keys from the streaming
          loader into a register (the raw weights, no arithmetic)
      - id: ac-4
        given: OpApplyModel result is in a register
        when: OpFilterDelta or OpMergeWeights uses it with a backbone register
        then: |
          WIDEN computes delta (model_weights - backbone) internally and
          routes by importance -- existing algorithm, unchanged
      - id: ac-5
        given: a recipe that mixes RecipeModel and RecipeLoRA nodes
        when: the exit node processes it
        then: |
          both paths execute correctly -- LoRA via existing DeltaSpec path,
          models via OpApplyModel streaming path
      - id: ac-6
        given: a checkpoint file whose detected architecture
        when: it differs from the base model architecture
        then: a clear error is raised naming both architectures and both file paths
      - id: ac-7
        given: full model weights loaded per-batch via streaming
        when: GPU evaluation completes for a batch
        then: |
          loaded weights are freed after use, not held resident
          (streaming loader re-reads from disk as needed)
      - id: ac-8
        given: GPU runs out of memory during full model evaluation
        when: OOM is caught
        then: |
          existing chunked_evaluation backoff retries at batch_size=1
          (compatible with streaming loader -- just re-reads fewer keys)
      - id: ac-9
        given: a RecipeModel with block_config
        when: per-block control is applied during execution
        then: |
          block-level strength scaling is applied to full model deltas
          the same way it applies to LoRA deltas
      - id: ac-10
        given: the checkpoint file does not exist or is not a valid safetensors file
        when: the exit node attempts to open it
        then: |
          a clear error is raised naming the missing file and which
          Model Input node referenced it
      - id: ac-11
        given: IS_CHANGED is called
        when: the recipe tree contains RecipeModel nodes
        then: |
          checkpoint file (mtime, size) is included in the hash alongside
          any LoRA file hashes
      - id: ac-12
        given: a recipe with only RecipeModel targets (no LoRAs)
        when: affected keys are computed
        then: |
          all diffusion model keys present in both base and merge model
          are processed (not just LoRA-affected subset)
      - id: ac-13
        given: a recipe composing 3 full models for merge
        when: execution runs
        then: |
          only one batch of model weights per loader is on GPU at a time
          (streaming loaders are read sequentially, not all at once)
