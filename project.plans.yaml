      ## Specs

      ```yaml
      - title: ComfyUI Packaging
        slug: comfyui-packaging
        type: feature
        description: |
          Node registration, Python packaging, and ComfyUI integration infrastructure.
          Covers __init__.py NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS, pyproject.toml with [tool.comfy],
          requirements.txt, and CATEGORY namespace (ecaj/*).
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: comfy-ecaj-nodes is installed in ComfyUI custom_nodes
            when: ComfyUI starts
            then: all registered nodes appear under the ecaj category in the node menu
          - id: ac-2
            given: a new node class is added to a nodes/ module
            when: it is added to NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS in __init__.py
            then: ComfyUI discovers it without changes to other files
          - id: ac-3
            given: pyproject.toml defines [tool.comfy] metadata
            when: the package is published to the ComfyUI registry
            then: it displays as ECAJ Nodes with publisher ecaj
          - id: ac-4
            given: the CATEGORY namespace uses ecaj/merge for WIDEN nodes
            when: future non-merge nodes are added
            then: they use ecaj/<domain> following the established lowercase pattern
        implementation_notes: |
          Skeleton exists in __init__.py (5 WIDEN mappings) and pyproject.toml.
          Validate NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS pattern works with ComfyUI node discovery.
          CATEGORY must use lowercase ecaj/ prefix with sub-categories per capability
          area (e.g., ecaj/merge for WIDEN nodes). Existing stubs use ECAJ/merge --
          update all to lowercase ecaj/merge. For the task: review ComfyUI's
          nodes_core.py loading path, verify pyproject.toml [tool.comfy] fields match
          registry requirements (PublisherId, DisplayName, Icon), ensure requirements.txt
          lists only dependencies ComfyUI doesn't already provide (torch and safetensors
          are provided by ComfyUI -- check if we need them at all), update CATEGORY on
          all 5 existing node stubs from ECAJ/merge to ecaj/merge.
          Files: __init__.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, nodes/entry.py,
          nodes/lora.py, nodes/compose.py, nodes/merge.py, nodes/exit.py.

        type: feature
        description: |
          pytest configuration, ComfyUI mocking strategy, and test fixtures for
          recipe tree construction. Must support testing nodes without a running
          ComfyUI instance.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: a developer runs pytest from the project root
            when: tests execute
            then: all tests pass without requiring a running ComfyUI instance
          - id: ac-2
            given: a test needs a ModelPatcher-like object
            when: it uses the mock fixture
            then: |
              the mock provides model_state_dict(), clone(), add_patches(),
              get_key_patches(), patches_uuid, and model.diffusion_model state
              dict access
          - id: ac-3
            given: a test needs a recipe tree
            when: it uses recipe fixtures
            then: |
              pre-built recipe trees for single-LoRA, multi-LoRA set, compose,
              and chain patterns are available
          - id: ac-4
            given: tests for nodes that use ComfyUI APIs like folder_paths
            when: they run without ComfyUI installed
            then: the APIs are mocked via conftest.py fixtures
        implementation_notes: |
          Create tests/conftest.py with: (1) MockModelPatcher class -- needs
          model_state_dict(filter_prefix) returning a dict of fake tensors keyed like
          diffusion_model.input_blocks.0.0.weight, clone() returning a new
          MockModelPatcher, add_patches(patches, strength_patch, strength_model)
          storing patches, get_key_patches(filter_prefix) returning patch data,
          patches_uuid property. Use small tensors (e.g., 4x4 float32) for speed.
          (2) Recipe tree fixtures -- recipe_base() returning RecipeBase with
          MockModelPatcher and arch=sdxl, recipe_single_lora(), recipe_lora_set()
          (2 LoRAs chained), recipe_compose() (2 branches), recipe_chain() (2
          sequential merges), recipe_full() (compose + chain like hyphoria example
          from design doc section 6.5). (3) Mock folder_paths module --
          get_filename_list(loras) returning [test.safetensors]. (4) pytest config
          in pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options] with testpaths=[tests].
          Files: tests/conftest.py, pyproject.toml (pytest config section).

      ## Specs


      ```yaml

      - title: Recipe Type System
        slug: recipe-system
        type: feature
        description: |
          The WIDEN custom ComfyUI type and its recipe dataclasses. All recipe
          objects are frozen (immutable) to prevent aliasing bugs with ComfyUI
          caching and graph fan-out. Fields use tuples, not lists. Recipe objects
          hold no GPU tensors -- they are pure recipe descriptions.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: any recipe dataclass instance
            when: a field is assigned after construction
            then: a FrozenInstanceError is raised
          - id: ac-2
            given: a RecipeCompose with existing branches
            when: a new branch is appended
            then: a new RecipeCompose is returned with a new tuple (persistent tree semantics)
          - id: ac-3
            given: any recipe object
            when: inspected for GPU tensors
            then: no torch.Tensor objects are found (only references and metadata)
          - id: ac-4
            given: RecipeBase, RecipeLoRA, RecipeCompose, and RecipeMerge classes
            when: imported from lib.recipe
            then: all four are available and constructible with documented fields
          - id: ac-5
            given: nodes that output WIDEN type and nodes that accept WIDEN input
            when: ComfyUI loads the node pack
            then: WIDEN wire connections are valid between nodes in the graph editor
        implementation_notes: |
          Partially implemented in lib/recipe.py -- has all 4 dataclasses but
          missing BlockConfig (added later in per-block-control). The WIDEN custom
          type is registered implicitly by ComfyUI when a node declares
          RETURN_TYPES = ("WIDEN",) -- no explicit registration needed, but verify
          this works by checking that ComfyUI type system allows connections between
          nodes sharing the custom type name. AC-5 can be tested by constructing a
          mock workflow JSON with WIDEN connections and validating against ComfyUI
          graph validation, or by testing in a running ComfyUI instance. For the
          task: verify existing dataclasses match design doc section 6.6, ensure all
          fields use tuples (not lists), verify frozen=True on all, add __all__
          export list. Consider adding RecipeNode = Union[RecipeBase, RecipeLoRA,
          RecipeCompose, RecipeMerge] type alias for type checking.
          Files: lib/recipe.py.

      - title: Entry Node
        slug: entry-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          Boundary from ComfyUI MODEL world to WIDEN recipe world. Wraps a
          ModelPatcher reference in a RecipeBase. Auto-detects architecture
          (SDXL, Z-Image, Flux, Qwen) by inspecting state dict key patterns.
          Zero GPU work -- just stores reference and arch tag.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: a ComfyUI MODEL (ModelPatcher) input
            when: Entry node executes
            then: it returns a RecipeBase wrapping the ModelPatcher reference
          - id: ac-2
            given: an SDXL model with diffusion_model.input_blocks keys
            when: architecture detection runs
            then: arch field is set to sdxl
          - id: ac-3
            given: a Z-Image model with diffusion_model.layers keys and noise_refiner
            when: architecture detection runs
            then: arch field is set to zimage
          - id: ac-4
            given: Entry node executes
            when: output is inspected
            then: no GPU memory is allocated and no tensors are copied
          - id: ac-5
            given: a model whose state dict keys match none of the known architecture patterns
            when: architecture detection runs
            then: it raises a clear error listing supported architectures
        implementation_notes: |
          Stub in nodes/entry.py. Architecture detection function should live in
          lib/arch_detect.py (or inline if small) -- inspect model.model_state_dict()
          keys for patterns: SDXL has input_blocks, middle_block, output_blocks;
          Z-Image has layers.N. plus noise_refiner; Flux has double_blocks; Qwen
          has transformer_blocks at depth 60. Check patterns in order of specificity
          (Z-Image before generic layers). For unsupported arch error, include first
          5 state dict key prefixes in the error message for debugging. ModelPatcher
          is stored as-is in RecipeBase (reference only, no clone, no tensor ops).
          Test by constructing MockModelPatcher instances with different key patterns
          and asserting detected arch.
          Files: nodes/entry.py, optionally lib/arch_detect.py.

      - title: LoRA Node
        slug: lora-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          Declares a LoRA to be applied as part of the recipe. Uses our own
          loader (not ComfyUI built-in) for deferred loading enabling batched
          bmm apply at Exit time. Chains via optional prev input to form sets
          (multiple LoRAs applied to the same base).
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: a LoRA file path and strength value
            when: LoRA node executes
            then: it returns a RecipeLoRA with the file path and strength in its loras tuple
          - id: ac-2
            given: two LoRA nodes chained via prev connection
            when: the second node executes
            then: the output RecipeLoRA contains both LoRAs in its loras tuple forming a set
          - id: ac-3
            given: the LoRA node in ComfyUI UI
            when: the node renders
            then: lora_name shows a dropdown via folder_paths.get_filename_list loras
          - id: ac-4
            given: a LoRA node with no prev connection
            when: it executes
            then: the output RecipeLoRA has a single-element loras tuple
          - id: ac-5
            given: a LoRA node with strength 0.0
            when: it executes
            then: |
              the LoRA still appears in the recipe (strength=0 is the executor
              concern, not the recipe builder concern)
        implementation_notes: |
          Stub in nodes/lora.py. The lora_name input must change from STRING type
          to use folder_paths.get_filename_list(loras) -- the ComfyUI pattern is:
          import folder_paths then lora_name: (folder_paths.get_filename_list(loras),)
          as a combo input. Full file path resolved at Exit time via
          folder_paths.get_full_path(loras, lora_name). The prev input receives a
          RecipeLoRA from a previous LoRA node -- extract its .loras tuple and
          concatenate: new_loras = prev.loras + (dict(path=lora_name, strength=strength),).
          If prev is None, create single-element tuple. For the task: update
          INPUT_TYPES to use folder_paths combo, implement add_lora() method,
          handle prev chaining with tuple concatenation. Edge case: prev might
          be None (optional input).
          Files: nodes/lora.py.

      - title: Compose Node
        slug: compose-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          Accumulates branches for simultaneous WIDEN merging. Pure recipe building
          with zero computation. Chain multiple Compose nodes to accumulate any
          number of branches for the Merge node.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: a branch WIDEN input and no compose input
            when: Compose node executes
            then: it returns RecipeCompose with a single-element branches tuple
          - id: ac-2
            given: a branch input and a compose chain from a previous Compose
            when: Compose node executes
            then: it returns RecipeCompose with the new branch appended to existing branches
          - id: ac-3
            given: three Compose nodes chained together
            when: the final output is inspected
            then: all three branches are present in order
          - id: ac-4
            given: a RecipeBase wired directly to the branch input
            when: Compose node executes
            then: |
              it raises an error because branch must be a LoRA spec, compose group,
              or merge result -- a raw base without LoRAs is not a valid compose branch
        implementation_notes: |
          Stub in nodes/compose.py. Implementation: if compose is provided and is a
          RecipeCompose, extract its .branches tuple and append the new branch:
          RecipeCompose(branches=compose.branches + (branch,)). If compose is None,
          create RecipeCompose(branches=(branch,)). For AC-4 validation: check
          isinstance(branch, RecipeBase) and raise ValueError with message about
          needing to apply LoRAs first or use as a Merge base input. Valid branch
          types: RecipeLoRA, RecipeCompose, RecipeMerge. Also validate that compose
          input when provided is a RecipeCompose (not some other recipe type).
          Files: nodes/compose.py.

      - title: Merge Node
        slug: merge-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          The recipe builder for WIDEN merge operations. Produces RecipeMerge
          which the Exit node evaluates. Compose target triggers merge_weights,
          single target triggers filter_delta. Optional backbone override for
          explicit WIDEN importance reference.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: base and target WIDEN inputs with a t_factor value
            when: Merge node executes

            then: it forms a valid chain for sequential merging
          - id: ac-5
            given: a RecipeLoRA or RecipeCompose wired to the base input
            when: Merge node executes

              it raises an error because base must be RecipeBase or RecipeMerge

            given: t_factor is -1.0
            when: stored in RecipeMerge
            then: the value is preserved (Exit interprets -1.0 as passthrough with no WIDEN)
        implementation_notes: |
          Stub in nodes/merge.py. Implementation: validate base is RecipeBase or
          RecipeMerge (raise ValueError with specific message if not). Validate
          target is RecipeLoRA, RecipeCompose, or RecipeMerge (not RecipeBase).
          Then construct RecipeMerge(base=base, target=target, backbone=backbone,
          t_factor=t_factor). The t_factor slider range is -1.0 to 5.0, step 0.05
          (already correct in stub). -1.0 means passthrough -- interpreted by Exit
          node, not Merge node. Backbone defaults to None when not connected
          (optional input). For the task: add isinstance validation checks at top
          of merge(), construct and return RecipeMerge.

        slug: exit-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          The only node that performs GPU computation. Receives the complete recipe
          tree, validates it, executes the full batched GPU pipeline, and returns
          a ComfyUI MODEL with merged weights as set patches. Handles IS_CHANGED

          folder_paths.get_full_path(loras, name), and return hash of (mtime, size)
          tuples. Use os.path.getmtime() and os.path.getsize(). If any file missing,
          return float(NaN) to force re-execution. Progress reporting via

          LoRA compat: set patches work because ComfyUI calculate_weight() processes
          patches in list order -- set replaces first, then subsequent LoRA patches
          add on top. Depends on lib/executor.py, lib/recipe.py, all node implementations.

          the fused weight this LoRA targets. The offset tuple is (dimension=0,
          start, length) where start is 0/3840/7680 for q/k/v respectively and
          length is 3840. (3) Handle non-QKV keys (FFN, norm, etc.) as standard
          LoRA. Also handle LoKr weights if present -- these have lokr_w1, lokr_w2
          instead of lora_up/lora_down, use kind=lokr. The Diffusers key mapping
          handles patterns like transformer_blocks.0.attn.to_q -> layers.0.attention.qkv
          (with offset for q portion).

        implementation_notes: |
          Memory management is woven throughout lib/executor.py. Key patterns to port
          from merge-router scripts/lora_chain_merge.py: (1) Per-chunk cleanup: after
          transferring results to CPU, explicitly del base_batch and gpu intermediates
          then gc.collect() and torch.cuda.empty_cache(). (2) Per-group cleanup: between
          OpSignature groups, call gc.collect() + torch.cuda.empty_cache(). (3) Loader
          cleanup: after evaluation completes, call loader.cleanup() for each loader
          (which calls clear_delta_cache() and drops cached LoRA state). (4) Final
          cleanup: ensure returned merged_state dict contains only CPU tensors. The
          merge-router source has ~8 explicit gc.collect/empty_cache calls -- identify
          each and port the pattern. For AC-5 testing: use torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()
          before/after chunk and compare to compute_batch_size prediction. This is a
          cross-cutting concern -- its ACs affect implementation in lib/executor.py
          primarily, also nodes/exit.py (loader cleanup after execute completes) and
          lib/lora/base.py (cleanup interface).

          (groups of 3: IN00-02, IN03-05, IN06-08), middle_block, output_blocks
          (groups of 3). Z-Image has layers (groups of 5: L00-04, L05-09, ... L25-29),
          noise_refiner, context_refiner. Each slider FLOAT range 0.0-2.0, step 0.05.
          ComfyUI allows typing values outside slider range so -1.0 is accessible.

          (same shape + affecting sets), and per-block strength varies by key, need

      Restructure @testing-infrastructure into a parent feature with three sub-requirements,
      add a CI spec, and establish a project convention requiring AC-annotated test coverage
      for every implementation task.

              fixture provides a dict with representative key patterns for each
              supported architecture (input_blocks for SDXL, layers + noise_refiner
              for Z-Image)
        implementation_notes: |
          Use ComfyUI's own pattern from tests-unit/ and ComfyUI_Selectors:
          sys.modules patching in conftest.py before node imports. MockModelPatcher
          should use small tensors (4x4 float32) for speed. Recipe fixtures build
          on lib/recipe.py dataclasses. Arch fixtures provide representative state
          dict key sets for detection testing.

        implementation_notes: |
          Create tests/test_graph.py with helper functions that instantiate node
          classes and call their FUNCTION methods directly to build recipe trees.
          The mock executor is a lightweight tree walker (separate from the real
          executor) that returns an operation plan (list of {op: filter_delta|merge_weights,
          keys: ...}) without touching GPU. This validates the Exit node's recipe

      ## Implementation Notes

      The existing @testing-infrastructure spec and task need to be restructured:
      the current spec becomes the parent feature, its ACs are redistributed into
      the new sub-requirements (comfyui-mocking absorbs the original ACs), and the
      existing task is updated to reflect the new scope.

      Additionally, a project convention should be established requiring AC-annotated
      test coverage (# AC: @spec ac-N) for every implementation task. This is enforced
      by the local-review workflow which checks for AC annotations in test files.

    title: Full Model Merging — WIDEN on Full Checkpoints
    content: |
      # Full Model Merging — WIDEN on Full Checkpoints

      Extends the WIDEN merge pipeline to support full model checkpoint merging
      alongside existing LoRA merging. Models are loaded from disk out-of-band
      from ComfyUI using safetensors streaming (safe_open), matching the deferred
      loading pattern used for LoRAs. This avoids requiring ComfyUI to load
      additional models into memory and enables per-batch streaming for large
      checkpoints.

      merge-router (sibling project at ../merge-router, used for offline merge
      experiments) already proves WIDEN works on full model state dicts. The gap
      is plumbing full model weights through the ComfyUI recipe tree and exit
      node execution pipeline.

      Architecture scope: SDXL and Z-Image (current supported set). Flux/Qwen
      architecture support is tracked separately.

      Key terminology: "WIDEN" is the custom ComfyUI type string used for all
      recipe nodes (RecipeBase, RecipeLoRA, RecipeCompose, RecipeMerge). Nodes
      with RETURN_TYPES = ("WIDEN",) can connect to any input accepting WIDEN.

      ## Specs

      ```yaml
      - title: Full Model Recipe Type
        slug: full-model-recipe
        type: feature
        description: |
          Frozen recipe dataclass representing a full model checkpoint to merge.
          Stores a file path and strength (like RecipeLoRA stores LoRA paths),
          not a ComfyUI MODEL reference. This enables deferred disk-based loading
          at Exit time via safetensors streaming. Follows all recipe conventions:
          frozen, tuples not lists, no GPU tensors.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: a RecipeModel instance
            when: a field is assigned after construction
            then: a FrozenInstanceError is raised
          - id: ac-2
            given: a RecipeModel
            when: inspecting its fields
            then: |
              it has path (str), strength (float, default 1.0), and
              block_config (BlockConfig or None, default None)
          - id: ac-3
            given: a RecipeModel instance
            when: passed to RecipeCompose.with_branch()
            then: a new RecipeCompose is returned containing it as a branch
          - id: ac-4
            given: a RecipeMerge constructed with target=RecipeModel
            when: the tree is inspected
            then: construction succeeds and target is the RecipeModel
          - id: ac-5
            given: the RecipeNode type alias
            when: inspected

          - id: ac-6
            given: a RecipeModel
            when: inspected for GPU tensors
            then: no torch.Tensor objects are found (path and strength only)
        implementation_notes: |
          Add to lib/recipe.py alongside existing dataclasses. Pattern follows
          RecipeLoRA but simpler -- single path+strength instead of tuple of
          LoRA dicts. No MappingProxyType needed (only scalar fields). Update
          __all__ and RecipeNode type alias to include RecipeModel.

          The path field stores the checkpoint filename (resolved to full path
          at Exit time via folder_paths, same as LoRA path resolution).
          block_config enables per-block strength control, reusing existing
          BlockConfig type.

        slug: model-input-node
        type: feature
        description: |
          ComfyUI node that produces a RecipeModel from a checkpoint file picker.
          Loads from disk out-of-band from ComfyUI -- the model is NOT loaded at
          node execution time. Like the LoRA node, this is pure recipe building
          with zero GPU work and zero file I/O. The file path is stored in the
          recipe and resolved at Exit time for deferred streaming access.
        acceptance_criteria:
          - id: ac-1
            given: the node's INPUT_TYPES
            when: inspected
            then: |
              it has model_name (checkpoint file combo via folder_paths) and
              strength (FLOAT, default 1.0, range 0.0-2.0)
          - id: ac-2
            given: the node executes with a valid checkpoint name
            when: output is inspected
            then: it returns a RecipeModel with the filename and strength stored

            given: the node executes
            when: checking GPU memory and disk I/O
            then: no GPU memory is allocated and no file is opened (deferred to Exit)

            given: an optional BLOCK_CONFIG input
            when: connected
            then: the BlockConfig is stored in RecipeModel.block_config
        implementation_notes: |
          New file nodes/model_input.py. Pattern follows nodes/lora.py closely:
          checkpoint file combo via folder_paths.get_filename_list("checkpoints"),
          strength slider, optional BLOCK_CONFIG input. No chaining (unlike LoRA
          node) -- each RecipeModel represents one model. To merge multiple models,
          use Compose node.

          Register in __init__.py NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS as
          "WIDENModelInput": WIDENModelInputNode with display name
          "WIDEN Model Input". The file path is stored as-is (the filename,
          not full path) -- Exit resolves via
          folder_paths.get_full_path("checkpoints", name) at execution time.

        type: feature
        description: |
          Streaming model loader using safetensors.safe_open() for memory-efficient
          per-batch access to full checkpoint weights. Matches the LoRALoader
          interface pattern but provides full weight tensors instead of low-rank
          factors. Handles key normalization between checkpoint file format and
          base model state dict format. Architecture-specific key mapping for
          SDXL and Z-Image. Only supports safetensors format (non-safetensors
          checkpoints raise a clear error).

              a clear error is raised explaining that only safetensors
              format is supported for model merging
        implementation_notes: |
          New file lib/model_loader.py. Uses safetensors.safe_open(path,
          framework="pt", device="cpu") context manager.

          Key normalization pipeline (runs once at open time):
          1. Read all keys from safe_open metadata (no tensor loading).
          2. Normalize: strip architecture-specific prefixes to canonical form.
             - SDXL files: strip "model.diffusion_model." prefix.
             - Z-Image files: strip "model.diffusion_model." or similar prefix.
             - Reference merge-router src/models/ for format-specific patterns.
          3. Filter: keep only diffusion model keys (drop VAE "first_stage_model."
             and text encoder "conditioner." / "cond_stage_model." keys).
          4. Build forward map: file_key -> base_model_key (normalized).
          5. Build reverse map: base_model_key -> file_key (for lookups).

          Architecture detection: run architecture patterns on NORMALIZED keys
          (post prefix-stripping), so the same _ARCH_PATTERNS from nodes/entry.py
          work. Detection must happen AFTER normalization, not before, since
          patterns expect state_dict-format keys (e.g., "diffusion_model.input_blocks"
          not "model.diffusion_model.input_blocks").

          get_weights(keys) calls f.get_tensor(reverse_map[key]) per key, returns
          list of tensors. Streaming means per-batch disk I/O but avoids full model
          in memory. The safe_open handle is kept open for the duration of execution
          (closed in cleanup()).

          Note: safetensors safe_open uses memory-mapping on supported platforms,
          but actual behavior may vary. The key guarantee is that tensors are not
          allocated in Python memory until get_tensor() is called.

          Files: lib/model_loader.py, reference lib/lora/base.py for interface
          pattern, reference merge-router src/models/ for key normalization.

          importance routing unchanged. Validates architecture consistency between

          This is the largest spec -- it touches every isinstance dispatch
          point that currently hardcodes the 4 recipe types. All changes needed:

          RECIPE TYPE SYSTEM (lib/recipe.py):
          - Add RecipeModel to RecipeNode type alias (line 86).
          - Add RecipeModel to __all__ exports.

          VALIDATION (nodes/exit.py _validate_recipe_tree):
          - Add RecipeModel as valid Compose branch type (line 62).
          - Add RecipeModel as valid Merge target type (line 81).
          - Add RecipeModel leaf case (no children to validate).

          RECIPE ANALYSIS (lib/analysis.py):
          - _walk_to_base(): RecipeModel cannot be tree root -- add case
            that raises ValueError like RecipeLoRA (line 71-75).
          - _collect_lora_sets(): Add RecipeModel case that skips (no LoRAs
            to collect) instead of raising ValueError (line 124).
          - New function _collect_model_refs(): Walk tree, collect unique
            RecipeModel nodes with synthetic model IDs (parallel to
            _collect_lora_sets pattern).
          - Extend analyze_recipe() or create analyze_recipe_models() to
            open FullModelLoader per unique path, validate arch match,
            build model affected-key maps. Return extended AnalysisResult
            with model_loaders and model_affected fields.
          - Extend get_keys_to_process(): Union of LoRA affected keys AND
            model affected keys determines which keys need processing.

          EXIT NODE (nodes/exit.py):
          - _collect_lora_paths(): Add RecipeModel skip case so tree walk
            doesn't raise on model nodes.
          - New _collect_model_paths(): Parallel function that collects
            checkpoint file paths from RecipeModel nodes.
          - _compute_recipe_hash(): Include model file (mtime, size) in hash.
          - execute(): Call model analysis, pass model_loaders to executor.
          - Cleanup: Close model loaders after execution completes.

          PLAN COMPILER (lib/recipe_eval.py):
          - New OpApplyModel frozen dataclass: model_id (str), block_config,
            input_reg (int), out_reg (int).
          - Add OpApplyModel to _Op type alias (line 78).
          - _input_regs(): Add OpApplyModel case returning (input_reg,).
          - _PlanCompiler.compile_node(): Add RecipeModel dispatch that
            emits OpApplyModel (parallel to _compile_lora pattern).
          - _PlanCompiler._compile_merge(): Add RecipeModel to valid
            target isinstance check (line 283).

          PLAN EXECUTOR (lib/recipe_eval.py):
          - execute_plan() gains new parameter:
            model_loaders: dict[str, FullModelLoader] | None = None
            This keeps backward compatibility (None = no models).
          - OpApplyModel handler: look up loader by model_id, call
            loader.get_weights(keys), stack into [B, *shape] tensor,
            move to device/dtype, store in register.
          - evaluate_recipe() wrapper passes model_loaders through.

          COMPOSE NODE (nodes/compose.py):
          - Add RecipeModel to valid branch types (line 48).

          MERGE NODE (nodes/merge.py):
          - Add RecipeModel to valid target types (line 77-81).

          KEY INSIGHT: OpApplyModel just loads weights into a register.
          It does NOT compute deltas. OpFilterDelta internally computes
          delta = input_reg - backbone_reg via WIDEN's filter_delta_batched.
          So full model merge reuses 100% of the WIDEN algorithm unchanged.

          MIXED RECIPES: compile_plan handles both node types independently.
          A chained merge like Merge(base=Merge(base=Entry, target=LoRA),
          target=Model) evaluates inner merge (LoRA path) first, then outer
          merge (model path) with inner result as base. The only naming
          confusion: execute_plan's variable "lora_applied" (line 397) is
          actually "the weights in input_reg" which may be raw model weights
          when from OpApplyModel. Consider renaming to "applied" for clarity.

          PERFORMANCE NOTE: For recipes with only RecipeModel targets (no
          LoRAs), affected_keys is the full diffusion model key set. This
          means ALL keys are processed, not a small LoRA subset. Batch sizing
          via compute_batch_size() handles this, but total processing time is
          proportionally higher. For SDXL: ~1500 keys vs ~200-400 for typical
          LoRA merges.

          MEMORY: Streaming loaders mean only 1 batch of model weights on GPU
          at a time. For SDXL with batch_size=64, this is ~100-500MB GPU per
          batch vs 4.2GB for full model. With 3 models in a Compose, each
          batch loads 3 × batch_size weights sequentially.

          nodes/exit.py, nodes/merge.py, nodes/compose.py.

      ## Implementation Notes

      The dependency chain for implementation:
      1. full-model-recipe (standalone, extends lib/recipe.py)
      2. model-input-node (depends on full-model-recipe)
      3. full-model-loader (standalone, new lib/model_loader.py)
      4. full-model-execution (depends on all above + existing exit-node + batched-executor)

      Key architecture decisions:
      - Disk-based loading, not ComfyUI MODEL: checkpoint files are opened
        directly via safetensors.safe_open() at Exit time, bypassing ComfyUI's
        model loading. This enables streaming per-batch access without full
        model in memory. Same pattern as LoRA deferred loading.
      - OpApplyModel is a "load" not "compute": it loads model weights into a
        register. WIDEN's filter_delta/merge_weights handles the delta internally.
      - Mixed recipes work naturally: LoRA and model nodes coexist in the same
        recipe tree via chained merges.
      - Per-block control reuses existing BlockConfig and block_classify
        infrastructure. No new classifiers needed for SDXL/Z-Image.
      - Only safetensors format supported. Non-safetensors checkpoints get a
        clear error message.
      - VAE/CLIP/text encoder keys in checkpoint files are filtered out --
        only diffusion model weights are merged.
      - Architecture detection runs on normalized keys (post prefix-stripping)
        so existing _ARCH_PATTERNS work unchanged.

      ## Implementation Notes

      Implementation order: Qwen first (simpler, no QKV fusion, has reference impl in
      ../merge-router), then Flux Klein (complex QKV fusing in both block types).

      Within each architecture, 3 tasks can run in parallel (detect-classify, model-loader,
      and then lora-loader + block-config after classify completes).

      Key reference files:
      - Qwen reference: ../merge-router/src/models/qwen_key_mapper.py (compound names)
      - Qwen reference: ../merge-router/scripts/qwen_merge.py (LoRA formats, lines 90-308)
      - QKV fusion pattern: lib/lora/zimage.py (lines 34-44, _QKV_OFFSETS)
      - Block config factory: nodes/block_config.py (make_block_config_node)
      - LoRA base class: lib/lora/base.py (LoRALoader abstract)
      - Current detection: nodes/entry.py (detect_architecture, _SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES)

      Existing architecture patterns (SDXL + Z-Image) serve as templates. Each new
      architecture adds: one classifier function, one set of layer type patterns, one
      LoRA loader module, one block config node module, and registry entries.

      Executor change for Flux linear1: lib/gpu_ops.py line 200 currently handles
      qkv_q/qkv_k/qkv_v kinds with offset-based slicing. Flux single_block linear1
      4-way split reuses qkv_* for Q/K/V and adds one new kind (e.g. "offset_mlp")
      to the same elif branch. This is a one-line tuple extension, not a new code
      path. The offset=(start, length) mechanism is already general-purpose.

      No changes needed to: lib/analysis.py (dispatches via registry), lib/per_block.py
      (dispatches via classify_key/classify_layer_type registries), nodes/exit.py
      (architecture-agnostic), lib/persistence.py (recipe serialization is
      architecture-agnostic).

          Both nodes are directory-based only with no architecture restriction --
          arch detection happens at Exit time. The existing Model Input Node keeps

          Full WIDEN-based text encoder merging pipeline for SDXL CLIP models.
          Uses a separate WIDEN_CLIP ComfyUI type for graph-level type safety,
          preventing accidental cross-connection with the diffusion model

      - title: Investigate ComfyUI CLIP clone and patch API
        slug: investigate-clip-api
        priority: 1
        description: |
          Spike task: investigate how ComfyUI CLIP objects support cloning
          and weight patching. Determine if CLIP uses ModelPatcher internally
          (in which case add_patches with set works) or needs a different
          mechanism (load_sd, direct state_dict manipulation). Document
          findings as task notes. This blocks CLIP Exit Node implementation.
        tags:
          - spike
          - enhancement-2
      ```


      ## Implementation Notes


      ### Enhancement 1: Diffusion Model Input

      Small scope. Add source_dir field to RecipeModel, create new node file, update exit path
      resolver and all serialization/hashing call sites. Rename existing node display name. The
      ComfyUI folder name may be "diffusion_models" or "unet" depending on version -- use whichever
      folder_paths supports (check at runtime with try/except fallback). Cache invalidation from the
      new source_dir field is expected and acceptable (silent cache miss, clean re-evaluation).


      ### Enhancement 2: CLIP Merging

      Larger scope but leverages existing infrastructure heavily. Key architectural addition: the
      `domain` field on RecipeBase enables (arch, domain) dispatch throughout the pipeline without
      changing arch strings.


      **Domain-based routing:**

      - RecipeBase gets `domain: str = "diffusion"` (backward compat default)

      - CLIP Entry sets `domain="clip"`

      - `get_loader(arch, domain)` selects correct LoRA loader

      - `classify_key(key, arch, domain)` selects correct block classifier

      - `analyze_recipe()` / `analyze_recipe_models()` pass domain through

      - Persistence serialization includes domain in hashes


      **Reusable infrastructure (no changes needed):**

      - recipe_eval.py: operates on arbitrary key sets, domain-agnostic

      - gpu_ops.py: DeltaSpec, apply_lora_batch_gpu, chunked_evaluation

      - per_block.py: uses classify_key() which handles domain dispatch

      - batch_groups.py: uses classify_key() which handles domain dispatch


      **Architecture-specific new code:**

      1. Entry/Exit nodes (CLIP object wrapping and patching)

      2. LoRA key mapping (te1/te2 prefix handling)

      3. Model loader key filtering (include CLIP, exclude UNet)

      4. Block classification (CLIP-L and CLIP-G block patterns)


      The CLIP graph nodes (LoRA, Compose, Merge, ModelInput) are thin wrappers via a
      make_clip_variant() factory that swaps WIDEN for WIDEN_CLIP.


      **Risk areas:**

      - CLIP patching: highest risk. Spike task investigates API before implementation.

      - Key mapping verification: CLIP-L/CLIP-G embedder ordering in checkpoints and LoRA te1/te2
      mapping need verification against real files.

      - v1 scope: no incremental block recompute for CLIP Exit (add later).

      - v1 scope: no persistence cache for CLIP Exit (add later).
