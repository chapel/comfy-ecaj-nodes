    description: Research and design phase for plan-to-spec translation. Explore codebase, clarify

    steps:

        content: >-
          Explore and research the codebase.


          Understand: existing specs/items in the domain, related patterns, current code structure,
          traits that may apply.


          Use /spec skill knowledge for spec types, AC format, and trait reference.


          Focus on what already exists to avoid duplication. Use parallel searches for efficiency.

          Present structured questions with clear options. One question at a time - do not batch
          multiple questions.


          Each question should resolve a specific design choice or scope decision.


          Continue until no open questions remain. Capture answers as they inform the design.
      - type: action
        content: >-
          Design the approach.


          Synthesize exploration findings, user answers, and requirements into a concrete design.


          Propose: spec items needed, AC for each, applicable traits, parent placement, and task
          structure.


          Write the design to a durable artifact (plan file or document) so it survives session
          boundaries.

          Address review feedback - fix gaps, refine AC, add missing traits. Iterate until review

          Review for: (1) completeness - gaps or missing scenarios, (2) consistency - specs align
          with existing patterns, (3) spec coverage - proper types, AC quality, trait applicability
          per /spec skill, (4) edge cases.


          Exit criteria: design written to file, all review issues addressed.
      - type: decision
        content: Choose execution path based on the reviewed plan
        options:
          - Import path - write structured plan document and auto-generate (3+ specs, batch creation)
          - Manual path - create specs incrementally with kspec commands (1-2 specs, quick additions)
