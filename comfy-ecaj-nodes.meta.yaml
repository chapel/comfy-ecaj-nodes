      - type: action
        content: |-
          Identify the pattern to formalize.
          What process/checklist are you capturing? Where is it documented?
          Look for: step-by-step instructions, checklists, repeated sequences.
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Define the trigger - when does this workflow start?
          Common triggers: manual, session-start, session-end, task-complete,
          behavior-change, pre-release, pr-merge
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Design the steps. For each step decide:
          - Type: action (do something), check (verify condition), decision (choose path)
          - Content: clear instruction, can be multiline
          - For checks: on_fail message
          - For decisions: options list
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Create the workflow:
          kspec meta add workflow --id <id> --trigger <trigger> --description "..." --steps "[...]"
      - type: decision
        content: Does this workflow need a matching skill for additional context?
        options:
          - Yes - create/update skill in .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
          - No - workflow is self-contained or context exists elsewhere
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Test the workflow:
          kspec workflow start @workflow-id
          Run through each step with workflow next
          Verify inputs/notes are captured correctly

    description: Autonomous reflection for loop mode. High-confidence captures only. MUST search
      existing before capturing. No user interaction.
    steps:
      - type: action
        content: |-
          MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Search existing state before identifying anything.
          Run these searches in parallel:
          - kspec meta observations list
          - kspec inbox list
          - kspec tasks list

          This establishes baseline to prevent duplicates.
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Identify high-confidence friction points and successes.

          HIGH CONFIDENCE criteria:
          - Concrete and specific (not vague)
          - Systemic/repeatable (not one-off)
          - Clear cause and effect
          - Agent has certainty about the pattern

          LOW CONFIDENCE (DO NOT capture):
          - Vague observations
          - Uncertain patterns
          - One-off issues
          - Hypothetical problems

          For each item identified, check against search results from step 1.
      - type: decision
        content: |-
          For each potential item, evaluate against existing state:

          If matches existing observation/inbox/task -> SKIP IT, note existing ref
          If unique AND high-confidence -> CAPTURE IT
          If vague/uncertain -> SKIP IT
      - type: action
        content: |-
          Capture approved items automatically (no user prompt):

          - Systemic friction: kspec meta observe friction "..."
          - Successful patterns: kspec meta observe success "..."
          - Open questions: kspec meta question add "..."
          - Actionable improvements with scope: kspec inbox add "..." --tag reflection

          Only capture items that passed the evaluation in step 3.
          Be selective - lower volume, higher quality.

        content: |-
          Select task by priority order.
          First, run kspec tasks ready --eligible — its output is authoritative.
          Check in order:
          1. in_progress tasks (continue existing work)
          2. Ready tasks that unblock others (high impact)

          - kspec tasks ready --eligible returned empty -> stop responding (ralph exits

          Verify work is needed - but VALIDATE, do not trust notes.

          Notes are context, not proof. If a task is in the queue, there is a reason.

          To mark Already implemented you MUST:
          1. RUN the tests - they must PASS, not skip
          2. VERIFY AC coverage - each AC has a corresponding test
          3. CHECK implementation matches spec requirements

          DO NOT mark complete just because:
          - Notes say already done (verify yourself)
          - Tests exist but skip in CI (that is a gap to fix)
          - Someone said it was implemented (run the tests)
        on_fail: |-
          Only if tests PASS and ACs are COVERED:
          Mark task complete with Already implemented reason and EXIT

          Work on the task, adding notes as you go.
          Use: kspec task note @task "What you are doing..."
          Add notes during work, not just at end.

          SCOPE EXPANSION: If you discover missing implementation while testing,
          implementing it IS in scope. The goal is verified behavior, not just test files.
          Add tests for X means ensure X is verified - if X does not exist, implement it.

          Read task notes for any DoD criteria. Common constraints:
          - No test.skip() calls - verify no skipped tests in changes
          - All ACs covered - verify each AC has corresponding test
          - No TODO/FIXME - no placeholder comments

          If DoD criteria exist and are not met, fix the gaps first.
