Single block linear1 4-way fusing (to_q/to_k/to_v/proj_mlp) uses qkv_* for Q/K/V and new offset_mlp kind for MLP projection. Added offset_mlp to gpu_ops.py offset-aware kinds tuple at line 200. Registered FluxLoader in LOADER_REGISTRY. Updated tests: changed test_unsupported_arch_raises_value_error to use 'unknown_arch', added test_flux_loader_selected_for_flux_arch, added TestFluxLoader class with 12 tests covering ac-4, ac-5, ac-6, ac-7. 789 tests pass, ruff clean."
