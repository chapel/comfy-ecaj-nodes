      "content": "Fixed SDXL key parsing algorithm. The original implementation naively split all underscores into dots, breaking compound identifiers like input_blocks, transformer_blocks, proj_in, proj_out, to_q, to_k, to_v. Implemented _tokenize_lora_path() with greedy matching for 16 known compound tokens. Added 21 tests in test_sdxl_loader.py covering all 3 ACs: AC-1 (block type mapping for input_blocks/middle_block/output_blocks), AC-2 (DeltaSpec contents: kind, up/down factors, rank, scale), AC-3 (attention key mapping: proj_in, proj_out, to_q/to_k/to_v/to_out). All 312 tests pass, ruff clean."

Updated lib/executor.py evaluate_recipe to handle single-branch RecipeCompose as filter_delta not merge_weights (AC-6). Added 22 tests in tests/test_exit_node.py covering all 8 ACs.

SDXL LoRA key mapping: keys follow\npatterns like lora_unet_input_blocks_0_0_op.lora_down.weight -> base key\ninput_blocks.0.0.weight. ComfyUI own comfy/lora.py has model_lora_keys_unet()\nthat builds this mapping. Options: (1) Use ComfyUI key mapping function and\nwrap in our loader interface, (2) Implement standalone for consistency.\nRecommend option (1) for SDXL since ComfyUI handles all edge cases (attention,\nproj_in/out, time_embed). Load safetensors with safetensors.torch.load_file(),\nmap keys, extract up/down/alpha per key, construct DeltaSpec objects.
