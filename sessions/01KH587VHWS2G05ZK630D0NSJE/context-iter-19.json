      "content": "Implemented per-block t_factor support for merge operations. Created lib/block_classify.py with SDXL and Z-Image key classification (classify_key_sdxl, classify_key_zimage). Updated lib/executor.py with _get_block_t_factors helper that groups keys by their effective t_factor, and _apply_widen_filter_per_block/_apply_widen_merge_per_block functions that process each t_factor group with appropriate WIDEN instance. Updated nodes/exit.py to pass arch and widen_config to evaluate_recipe. AC-1: when block_config is present, per-block t_factor overrides are applied. AC-2: when block_config is None, global t_factor applies to all blocks. 35 tests in test_merge_block_config.py covering block classification and t_factor grouping. 431 total tests pass, ruff clean."

Each slider is FLOAT 0.0-2.0 step 0.05. Added BLOCK_CONFIG optional input to WIDENLoRANode and WIDENMergeNode for fan-out support.
