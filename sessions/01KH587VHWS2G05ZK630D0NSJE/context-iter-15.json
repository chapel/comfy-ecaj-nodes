      "content": "Implemented Z-Image LoRA Loader with complete @zimage-loader AC coverage. Added DeltaSpec.offset field for QKV slice indexing (AC-3). Enhanced _parse_zimage_lora_key() to handle Diffusers key patterns including transformer./diffusion_model. prefixes, LyCORIS format with lycoris_ prefix, and to_out.0→out mapping (AC-2). QKV keys now fuse into single qkv.weight with proper offset tuples: q=(0,3840), k=(3840,3840), v=(7680,3840) (AC-1). Added _normalize_lycoris_key() for underscore→dot conversion preserving compound names. Created tests/test_zimage_loader.py with 20 tests covering all 3 ACs. All 332 tests pass, ruff clean."

Added 21 tests in test_sdxl_loader.py covering all 3 ACs: AC-1 (block type mapping for input_blocks/middle_block/output_blocks), AC-2 (DeltaSpec contents: kind, up/down factors, rank, scale), AC-3 (attention key mapping: proj_in, proj_out, to_q/to_k/to_v/to_out).

Key function:\n_parse_lora_key(key) which maps Diffusers LoRA key names to S3-DiT base model\nkeys and identifies QKV components. Z-Image base model uses fused\nattention.qkv.weight (11520x3840 = 3x3840) but LoRAs have separate\nto_q/to_k/to_v. The loader must: (1) Parse each LoRA key to identify\ntarget parameter and QKV component. (2) For QKV keys, create DeltaSpecs\nwith kind=qkv and offset=(0, q_start, q_len) indicating which third of\nthe fused weight this LoRA targets. The offset tuple is (dimension=0,\nstart, length) where start is 0/3840/7680 for q/k/v respectively and\nlength is 3840. (3) Handle non-QKV keys (FFN, norm, etc.) as standard\nLoRA. Also handle LoKr weights if present -- these have lokr_w1, lokr_w2\ninstead of lora_up/lora_down, use kind=lokr. The Diffusers key mapping\nhandles patterns like transformer_blocks.0.attn.to_q -> layers.0.attention.qkv\n(with offset for q portion).\nFiles: lib/lora/zimage.py.\n"
