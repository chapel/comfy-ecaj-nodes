Updated lib/executor.py evaluate_recipe to handle single-branch RecipeCompose as filter_delta not merge_weights (AC-6). Added 22 tests in tests/test_exit_node.py covering all 8 ACs.

The execute() method: (1) Validate recipe tree structure by\nwalking recursively and checking types at each node. (2) Call batched\nexecutor from lib/executor.py which handles phases 1-3. (3) Install\nresults as set patches on a ModelPatcher clone. The IS_CHANGED classmethod\nmust walk recipe tree to find all RecipeLoRA nodes, resolve file paths via\nfolder_paths.get_full_path(loras, name), and return hash of (mtime, size)\ntuples. Use os.path.getmtime() and os.path.getsize(). If any file missing,\nreturn float(NaN) to force re-execution. Progress reporting via\ncomfy.utils.ProgressBar(total_steps) -- get total from executor. Downstream\nLoRA compat: set patches work because ComfyUI calculate_weight() processes\npatches in list order -- set replaces first, then subsequent LoRA patches\nadd on top.
