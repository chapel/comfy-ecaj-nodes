Created detect_architecture() function with pattern matching for SDXL (input_blocks/middle_block/output_blocks), Z-Image (layers + noise_refiner), Flux (double_blocks), and Qwen (60+ transformer_blocks). Flux/Qwen are detected but raise UnsupportedArchitectureError. Added 17 tests covering all 5 ACs: AC-1 (returns RecipeBase), AC-2 (SDXL detection), AC-3 (Z-Image detection), AC-4 (no GPU/tensor copy), AC-5 (unsupported arch errors).
