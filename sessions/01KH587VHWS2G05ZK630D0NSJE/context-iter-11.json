Tree walk: recursive function following\nRecipeMerge.base links until hitting RecipeBase. Collect all RecipeLoRA\nnodes by walking .target and .base recursively. Set ID assignment:\nidentity-based -- with frozen dataclasses, chained LoRAs produce a single\nRecipeLoRA with a multi-element tuple, so each unique RecipeLoRA instance\nequals one set. LoRA loading: select loader from lib/lora/{arch}.py based\non RecipeBase.arch. Resolve file paths with folder_paths.get_full_path(loras,\nname). Build affected-key map by calling loader.affected_keys for each set.\nThe tree walk and set ID assignment is the most critical piece -- get the\nidentity semantics right.\nFiles: lib/executor.py, references lib/lora/base.py interface.\n"
