# comfy-ecaj-nodes

> **Work in progress**

A ComfyUI custom node pack for the nodes I want but don't exist yet.

Currently focused on **WIDEN-based LoRA merging** — weight disentanglement for intelligent parameter-level model composition. Instead of simple linear interpolation, WIDEN analyzes per-parameter importance across models and routes each parameter to the most relevant contributor.

Supported architectures for v1: **SDXL** and **Z-Image**.
