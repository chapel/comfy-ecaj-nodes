- title: Port design doc into kspec specs and tasks
  description: Translate the ComfyUI node pack design document
    (~/Projects/merge-router/docs/comfyui-node-pack-design.md) into kspec spec items (modules,
    features, requirements with acceptance criteria) and derive implementation tasks. This should be
    done as a design session with review checkpoints — not all at once.
