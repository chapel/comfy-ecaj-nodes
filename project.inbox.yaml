    text: Recipe serialization as a trait/protocol — serialize_recipe currently uses isinstance checks
      for each recipe type. Should be a protocol method on RecipeNode so new recipe types implement
      their own serialization. Prevents silent skips and keeps persistence.py decoupled from recipe
      type enumeration.

    text: compute_lora_stats._walk() silently ignores unknown recipe node types — should raise
      ValueError like serialize_recipe does. Related to serialization-as-trait refactor.

    text: load_affected_keys should wrap safetensors errors with helpful message pointing to cached file
      corruption — tells users to delete and re-run.

    text: kspec plan import should wire depends_on from task YAML — currently ignores the field,
      requiring manual kspec batch to set dependencies after import. Encountered when importing
      Qwen/Flux plan with 4 dependent tasks.

    text: "v2: Auto per-block LoRA importance analysis for targeted merging — compute Frobenius norm of
      B@A per block at recipe build time to auto-populate per-block strengths. Could extend to SVD
      spectral analysis, TIES/DARE pruning during merge execution, and TSV interference detection
      for multi-LoRA conflict prediction. Natural hook point: existing per_block.py infrastructure.
      See FreeFuse (spatial segmentation, different problem), LoRA Inspector, resize_lora, LoRA
      Power-Merger, Task Singular Vectors paper for prior art."
