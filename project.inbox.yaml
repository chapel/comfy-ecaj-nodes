    text: Recipe serialization as a trait/protocol — serialize_recipe currently uses isinstance checks
      for each recipe type. Should be a protocol method on RecipeNode so new recipe types implement
      their own serialization. Prevents silent skips and keeps persistence.py decoupled from recipe
      type enumeration.

    text: compute_lora_stats._walk() silently ignores unknown recipe node types — should raise
      ValueError like serialize_recipe does. Related to serialization-as-trait refactor.

    text: load_affected_keys should wrap safetensors errors with helpful message pointing to cached file
      corruption — tells users to delete and re-run.

    text: kspec plan import should wire depends_on from task YAML — currently ignores the field,
      requiring manual kspec batch to set dependencies after import. Encountered when importing
      Qwen/Flux plan with 4 dependent tasks.
