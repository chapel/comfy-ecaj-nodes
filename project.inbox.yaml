    text: "Exit node: add toggle + text input to save merged model to disk. Two purposes: (1) persist
      finished merge for easy reuse as a regular model, (2) cache — if saved file exists and config
      matches, load directly instead of recomputing. Cache invalidation must account for: recipe
      tree identity (ops/weights/modes), LoRA file changes on disk (hash or mtime), base model
      identity, per-block strength configs. Design questions: hash strategy (recipe+file stats vs
      structured metadata), save location (models dir vs cache dir vs user path), format
      (safetensors with metadata keys for validation), force-recompute override."
