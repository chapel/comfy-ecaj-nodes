    text: Recipe serialization as a trait/protocol — serialize_recipe currently uses isinstance checks
      for each recipe type. Should be a protocol method on RecipeNode so new recipe types implement
      their own serialization. Prevents silent skips and keeps persistence.py decoupled from recipe
      type enumeration.
