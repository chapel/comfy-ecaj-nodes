    text: Recipe serialization as a trait/protocol — serialize_recipe currently uses isinstance checks
      for each recipe type. Should be a protocol method on RecipeNode so new recipe types implement
      their own serialization. Prevents silent skips and keeps persistence.py decoupled from recipe
      type enumeration.

    text: compute_lora_stats._walk() silently ignores unknown recipe node types — should raise
      ValueError like serialize_recipe does. Related to serialization-as-trait refactor.

    text: kspec plan import should wire depends_on from task YAML — currently ignores the field,
      requiring manual kspec batch to set dependencies after import. Encountered when importing
      Qwen/Flux plan with 4 dependent tasks.

    text: "v2: Auto per-block LoRA importance analysis for targeted merging — compute Frobenius norm of
      B@A per block at recipe build time to auto-populate per-block strengths. Could extend to SVD
      spectral analysis, TIES/DARE pruning during merge execution, and TSV interference detection
      for multi-LoRA conflict prediction. Natural hook point: existing per_block.py infrastructure.

      Power-Merger, Task Singular Vectors paper for prior art."

    text: Add test helper fixture for block config node kwargs — generate full kwargs from
      node.INPUT_TYPES() with defaults, so tests only need to override specific values. Would
      prevent the 15+ manual edits needed when adding new sliders (as happened with structural keys
      fix).

    text: kspec plan import puts manual task description field into notes instead of task description —
      task shows no Description section, only notes. Means manual tasks from plan import are less
      self-documenting than spec-derived tasks. Related to 01KHDNHH (depends_on gap) — both are plan
      import fidelity issues.
