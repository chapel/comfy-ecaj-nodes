    text: "WIDEN Exit node produces corrupted model output when executing the GPU merge pipeline. Nodes
      now execute (key prefix mismatch fixed) but the merged weights are wrong. Need to debug:
      evaluate_recipe data flow, WIDEN filter/merge math with real z-image tensors,
      install_merged_patches correctness, and possible dtype/device mismatches. Test with actual
      ComfyUI runtime."
