    text: Wrap evaluate_recipe and merge_weights_batched in torch.inference_mode() — autograd graphs
      currently built for pure inference ops, adding CPU overhead and memory pressure. Low effort,
      high impact perf fix. Affects recipe_eval.py:evaluate_recipe and
      widen.py:merge_weights_batched (backbone disentanglement outside no_grad block).
