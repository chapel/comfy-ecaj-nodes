    text: Audit MockModelPatcher for mock/production divergences. The key prefix mismatch bug
      (model_state_dict prefixed vs model.diffusion_model.state_dict unprefixed) was invisible to
      tests because the mock faithfully reproduced the same inconsistency. Review all
      MockModelPatcher API surfaces against real ComfyUI ModelPatcher behavior to catch similar
      hidden mismatches.

      ("set", (tensor,)) to match ComfyUI convention. Ensure @exit-patch-install ACs match actual
      implementation.
