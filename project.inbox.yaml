    text: Audit MockModelPatcher for mock/production divergences. The key prefix mismatch bug
      (model_state_dict prefixed vs model.diffusion_model.state_dict unprefixed) was invisible to
      tests because the mock faithfully reproduced the same inconsistency. Review all
      MockModelPatcher API surfaces against real ComfyUI ModelPatcher behavior to catch similar
      hidden mismatches.
